General Tips:
- Puzzles will often have multiple steps to get to the answer word. You can usually tell you are on the right track if the intermediate answers agree with the title, flavor, or theme of the puzzle.
- You can usually find hints in the introductory text. For example references to “in the dark” or “sight” are often hints something is encoded with braille.
- Puzzles often incorporate acrostics: a clue where the first letter, syllable, or word of each line, paragraph, or other recurring feature spells out a word or message.
- If you end up with a garbled “alphabet soup”, then look for a clue on how to order them.
- Indexing is one of the most common puzzle mechanisms. Try indexing when you have a list of words or phrases and a corresponding list of numbers. Count into the word or phrase by the given number and record the letter in that position. For example: "2 Cake, 6 Pudding, 5 Shortening" gives you "ant".
- Alpha-numeric codes are also very common. If you end up with a list of numbers try replacing the numbers with the corresponding letters like this: 1 = A, 2 = B, 3 = C... 26 = Z. Occasionally, these types of codes will “wrap around”, so don’t despair if you see a number greater than 26. Just subtract 26 and try again. In this scenario 27 (27-26 = 1) = A, 28 (28-26 = 2) = B etc. If you try this and it doesn’t work, try other numeric codes such as ASCII.
- Often a puzzle repeats a strategy multiple times.

You will likely need to backtrack frequently, so make sure to write out your steps as you go.
If you get stuck, try to think of a new way to approach the puzzle. Try:
- Rereading the title and the flavor text. These are the most important hints about what type of strategies, themes or cultural references might be used to solve the puzzle.
- Checking for pop culture references
- Checking for references to a song/poem/book/movie/TV show

For strings, examples of strategies you might try include:
- Alphabetizing
- Using leftover letters to spell something
- Rearranging the letters (aka anagrams or "transposing")
- Looking for unusual letter frequencies
- Puns and homophones
- Determining if it is a Rot 13/Caesar shift in general
- Shifting from letters to numbers
- Treating letters as protein sequences
- Treating letters as call letters
- Turning it into a cryptic crossword clue
- Seeing if these words relate to song lyrics
- Seeing if there are any acronyms of phrases
- Diagonalizing (taking the first letter of the first answer, the second letter of the second, etc.)
- Looking at a computer keyboard

For numbers, try:
- Graphing it functionally
- Graphing it parametrically
- Checking to see if your numbers are in the right base (including hex)
- Shifting from numbers to letters
- Using it as a phone number
- Using it as an IP address
- Matching numbers to MIT buildings or courses
- Treating numbers as dates
- Treating numbers as atomic weights, numbers, etc. (if chemistry themed)
- Treating numbers as latitude/longitude or GPS coordinates
- Treating numbers as radio stations
- Treating numbers as ASCII numbers
- Treating numbers as PLU numbers (if grocery themed)
- Treating numbers as ISBN numbers (if book themed)
- Seeing if there are any strange sequences
- Seeing if prime numbers are involved
- Seeing if fundamental constants are involved
- Asking what other numbers are close to the one you have

For images, try:
- Looking at it in a mirror
- Squinting at it from far away
- Tilting it
- Looking at it upside down
- Looking through it
- Transcribing it neatly
- Transcribing it on graph paper
- Connecting the dots
- Overlaying it on a map of MIT

For symbolic messages, try:
- Braille, Morse code, semaphores
- Binary or other encodings
- Using the Library of Congress or Dewey decimal system (if book-themed)
